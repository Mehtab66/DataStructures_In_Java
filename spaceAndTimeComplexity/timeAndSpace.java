// Time taked by a program to get executed is called time complexity.
// Space taken by a program to get executed is called space complexity.

// Ways to measure time and space complexity

// Big O Notation
// Theta Notation
// Omega Notation

// Big O Notation
// It is used to measure the worst case scenario of a program.

// Theta Notation
// It is used to measure the average case scenario of a program.

// Omega Notation
// It is used to measure the best case scenario of a program.

// Types of Big O Notation
// constant time complexity
// linear time complexity
// logarithmic time complexity
// quadratic time complexity
// cubic time complexity

// constant time complexity
// It is represented by O(1).
// It is the fastest time complexity.
// It takes constant time to execute a program.

// linear time complexity
// It is represented by O(n).
// It takes linear time to execute a program.
// It is slower than constant time complexity.

// Logarithmic time complexity
// It is represented by O(log n).
// It reduces the problem size in each step (e.g., binary search).
// It is faster than linear time complexity but slower than constant time
// complexity.

// Quadratic time complexity
//worst time complexity
// As the input increases the time taken by icreases by (n*n)
// It is represented by O(n²).
// It involves nested loops (e.g., checking all pairs in an array).
// It is slower than linear time complexity.

// Cubic time complexity
// It is represented by O(n³).
// As the input increases the time taken will be increased by 3 times (n*n*n)
// It involves three nested loops (e.g., checking all triplets in an array).
// It is slower than quadratic time complexity.
